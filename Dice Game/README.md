# Dice Game

A simple two-player dice game built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Description

This is a turn-based dice game where two players compete to reach 100 points first. On each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as they wish, accumulating points. However, if they roll a 1, their current turn score is lost and the turn switches to the other player. Players can also choose to "hold" to add their current turn score to their total score and pass the turn to the other player.

## How to Play

- Click **Roll Dice** to roll the dice.
- If the dice shows a number between 2 and 6, that number is added to your current score.
- If the dice shows a 1, your current score resets to 0, and it becomes the other player's turn.
- Click **Hold** to add your current score to your total score and switch turns.
- The first player to reach 100 points wins the game.
- Click **New Game** to reset the game and start over.
